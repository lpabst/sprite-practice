# Sprite Practice

Just a simple little canvas where you can walk around as a cat to practice sprite animations. 
- Different actions are coordinated with different sprite images
- Walking rotates between multiple images to get a walking effect
- standing still for long enough results in the cat sitting down, then laying down, then going to sleep
- The sprite sheet has a green background, so I gave my canvas a green background as well (#78C380)
- sprint by pressing 's'
- press 'b' to show your butt (a classic cat move)
