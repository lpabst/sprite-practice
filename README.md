# Sprite Practice

Just a simple little canvas where you can walk around as a cat to practice sprite animations. 
- Different actions are coordinated with different sprite images
- Walking rotates between multiple images to get a walking effect
- standing still for long enough results in the cat sitting down, then laying down, then going to sleep
